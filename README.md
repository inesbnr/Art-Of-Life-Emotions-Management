# Art Of Life : Emotions and Stress Management

WELCOME TO THE ART OF LIFE - EMOTIONS MANAGMENT GITHUB PAGE ! 

Art of Life is an artistic project developped at the Institute for Future Technologies by the Human Learning innovation group.  This project aims to be a platform for artistic creations based on human physiological signals for relaxation. The basis of the project relies on the use of multiple sensors, such as an Electrocardiogram, monitoring the heart signal of the user, or an Electrodermal Activity Sensor, monitoring the user's skin conductance and Respiration sensor monitoring the user’s breath pattern. 
The data recovered from the sensors is processed and sent through multiple softwares to output visuals.  The vision of this project was created in the idea of designing new ways for people to interact with their own biosignals for health improvement.

The inspiration for the output was inspired by the visual works of Luncinda Dilly and Light Mapping shows such as the Aura Invalides.  On this page, you can find the different files used through Visual Studio Code, OpenSignals(r) and MadMapper 5.0.7 in this project.

You can also find the documentation related to the project called "HowTo_ArtOfLife.md".
